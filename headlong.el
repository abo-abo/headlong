;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This package, akin to `ido-mode', modifies the built-in Emacs
;; completion, except it takes it in a reckless direction: as you type
;; in each character, it exits the minibuffer as soon as there is a
;; unique candidate.  This leaves no room for error, but in return you
;; get more speed.  Bookmarks can benefit from this completion method
;; the most.
